Check memory-usage
==================

Overview
--------

Displays the amount of free and used memory in the system and checks how much physical memory is left across platforms by using the "available" field.

Help
----

.. code-block:: text

    usage: memory-usage [-h] [-V] [--always-ok] [-c CRIT] [-w WARN]

    Displays amount of free and used memory in the system, checks against used memory in percent.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
      --always-ok           Always returns OK.
      -c CRIT, --critical CRIT
                            Set the critical threshold for memory usage (in percent). Default: 95
      -w WARN, --warning WARN
                            Set the warning threshold for memory usage (in percent). Default: 90


Usage Examples
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ./memory-usage
    ./memory-usage --warning 90 --critical 95
    
Output:

.. code-block:: text

    67.2% - total: 15.2GiB, used: 7.3GiB, available: 5.0GiB, free: 792.1MiB
    shared: 2.5GiB, buffers: 310.8MiB, cached: 6.8GiB

    Top3 most memory consuming processes:
    1. rambox: 15.4%
    2. Web Content: 9.6%
    3. packagekitd: 4.2%


States
------

* WARN or CRIT if total memory usage is above a given threshold.


Perfdata / Metrics
------------------

* available: The memory that can be given instantly to processes without the system going into swap. This is calculated by summing different memory values depending on the platform and it is supposed to be used to monitor actual memory usage in a cross platform fashion.
* buffers (Linux, BSD): Cache for things like file system metadata.
* cached (Linux, BSD): Cache for various things.
* free: Memory not being used at all (zeroed) that is readily available; note that this doesnâ€™t reflect the actual memory available (use ``available`` instead). ``total - used`` does not necessarily match ``free``.
* shared (Linux, BSD): memory that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple processes.
* total: Total physical memory (exclusive swap).
* usage_percent
* used: Memory used, calculated differently depending on the platform and designed for informational purposes only. ``total - free`` does not necessarily match ``used``.
