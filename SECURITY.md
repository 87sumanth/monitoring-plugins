# Reporting Security Issues

How to report any security issue you discovered:

* Please create a new [GitLab Issue](https://git.linuxfabrik.ch/linuxfabrik-icinga-plugins/checks-linux/issues/new?issue[assignee_id]=&issue[milestone_id]=).
* Be sure to activate the checkbox "This issue is confidential and should only be visible to team members with at least Reporter access."

We will assess the risk, plus make a fix available before we make this a public GitLab issue.

Thank you for your contribution.
