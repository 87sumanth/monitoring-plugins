* Don't throw a warning for "This firmware returns bogus raw values in attribute 197" (EXAMPLE16)
  This results in an attribute "197 Bogus_Current_Pend_Sect", which is - because of its new name - never be checked. So the check against the attribute works as intended by the smart-developers (197 is ignored), and therefore the warning is useless. Just print it.
  => "OK sda (CT500MX500SSD1, SerNo: 1904E1E58544, Hint: This firmware returns bogus raw values in attribute 197),"

* ignore-disk=sdc,serno
* ignore-non-zero-raw-values (so ignores all "..., but there is no SMART warning yet")

* ignore-attributes (all attributes for all disks)
* ignore-attributes='197,198' (for all disks)
* ignore-attributes='serno=197,198;212' (197, 198 for a specific disk, 212 for all)
