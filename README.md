# Python-based Checks for Icinga

This git repo provides various Python-based check plugins for Nagios compatible monitoring systems like Nagios and Icinga. All checks are written and tested on Fedora >= 30 and CentOS 7.


## Hints

To run a check make sure that the symbolic link `lib` points to `lib-linux`, which you have to clone from [lib-linux](https://gitlab.com/linuxfabrik-icinga-plugins/lib-linux).
